# WordPress Skeleton

Based in spirit on @markjaquith’s [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton).

## About

This project aims to minimize the time it takes creating a new WordPress project. It is based on my work for [5 Every Day](http://5everyday.com/).

## Installation

Clone this repo into your new WordPress project and run `composer install` to install. 

This will install WordPress into `webroot/wp/` and WordPress plugins into `webroot/content/plugins/`.

## Dependencies

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Plugins

Plugins are installed with Composer using the amazing [WordPress Packagist](http://wpackagist.org/).

### Base Plugins

These plugins are those that I use on every WordPress project. They are indispensable.

* [WordPress Importer](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/)
* [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
